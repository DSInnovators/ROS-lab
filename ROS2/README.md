# ROS2 and Gazebo

#### Environment setup for Ubuntu 20.04

0. Download *install_ros2.sh* in your computer.
1. Open a terminal and run <tt>sudo chmod +x install_ros2.sh</tt>.
2. Execute the bash file by running <tt>sudo ./install_ros2.sh</tt>.
3. Source the bashrc file <tt>source ~/.bashrc</tt>.

#### Check Environment Variables

```
$ printenv | grep -i ROS
```

The response should be -

```
ROS_VERSION=2
ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3
ROS_DISTRO=foxy
```

#### Run the project

##### Please make sure you have [gazebo_ros_pkgs](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros2_installing&cat=connect_ros) installed. Follow the instructions in the next session if you don't.

Clone the project in your machine, and run the simulation first. You have to provide execute permission for both the `.sh` files. Navigate to `ROS2` folder and follow the below instructions:
```
chmod +x run_script.sh
chmod +x venv_script.sh
```
Run the first script which will prompt the *gazebo simulation* and *keyboard control* in separate terminals.
```
./run_script.sh
```
Once the terminals are running, run the second script which will create a virtual environment and install all necessary requirements.
```
./venv_script.sh
```

## Keyboard Controlled Differential Drive Robot with ROS2 and Gazebo

#### Install gazebo_ros_pkgs
Gazebo is installed alongside ROS2. In order to install [gazebo_ros_pkgs](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros2_installing&cat=connect_ros), run the following command: 
```
$ sudo apt install ros-foxy-gazebo-ros-pkgs
```
Make sure you have some core tools installed: 
```
$ sudo apt install ros-foxy-ros-core ros-foxy-geometry2
```
To test if the **gazebo_ros_pkgs** was successfully installed, open a new terminal, source ROS2, and simulate a world file using the following command:
```
$ gazebo --verbose /opt/ros/foxy/share/gazebo_plugins/worlds/gazebo_ros_diff_drive_demo.world
```
You also need to have **python3** installed in your system.

#### Build custom plugin for differential drive robot

We will build a custom plugin and refer to that **.so** object in our world file. The world file is located in this repo under [*ROS2/world/gazebo_ros_diff_drive_demo.world*](https://github.com/DSInnovators/ROS-lab/blob/main/ROS2/world/gazebo_ros_diff_drive_demo.world). 

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:DSInnovators/ROS-lab.git`
2. Navigate to `ROS2/gazebo-ros-plugins/`
3. Run the following commands:
```
$ mkdir build # create a build folder
$ cd build # go to build folder
$ cmake ../ # compile
$ make
```
4. A **.so** file will be created inside the *build* folder, namely `libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so`.
5. Copy and paste the folder to a location where the **.world** file will be able to refer it from
```
$ rm -rf /opt/ros/foxy/lib/libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so # remove the previously fetched (with ros-gazebo-ros-pkgs) diff drive .so file 
$ cp ~/PATH_TO_REPO/ROS2/gazebo-ros-plugins/build/libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so /opt/ros/foxy/lib/libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so 
```
Use `sudo` command if necessary.

6. Open a terminal, run the world file:
```
$ cd ~/PATH_TO_REPO/ROS2/world
$ gazebo --verbose gazebo_ros_diff_drive_demo.world
```
A gazebo window will load with a differential drive robot.

7. Open another terminal and run the publisher:
```
$ cd ~/PATH_TO_REPO/ROS2/
$ python3 teleop_keyboard.py
```
8. Run the following command to check if the subscriber and publisher are running smoothly:
```
$ ros2 topic info --verbose /cmd_vel # cmd_vel is the name of the topic the publisher is publishing to and the subscriber is subscribing to
```
You should see a response like this:
```

9. See what sort of messages are published to the `/cmd_vel` topic:
```
$ ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel
```
Every time you press the keys according to the instructions in terminal running `teleop_leyboard.py`, you'll see a response like below:
```
linear:
  x: 0.5
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0

## Camera Sensor with Diff Drive Robot

1. Open a new terminal, and type `rviz2`
2. In the *Fixed Frame* option, type `camera_link`
3. Add a *Camera* from options under **rviz_default_plugins**
4. In the *Topic* field, put `/camera1/image_raw`

You will see a small screen containing the real time feed of the simulation. Play around by putting some objects in the gazebo simulation window.

### Object Detection with Machine Learning

We are using `frcnn-mobilenet` pre-trained network from `Pytorch`, using the `coco` dataset. Our ML implementation requires a few libraries and all of them are listed on the `requirements.txt`. In order to detect objects in our system (and in our world), pull the code, and install all necessary libraries (or if you're using PyCharm, create a venv with the requirements). Lastly, run `python object-detection.py` from the `subscribers` fokder.

[Here](https://www.loom.com/share/a476c8e4287c4d34b07e0dd0903536d5) is a demo video of our implementation.
